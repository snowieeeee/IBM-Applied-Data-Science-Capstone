# IBM-Applied-Data-Science-Capstone
This repository is dedicated to my IBM Applied Data Science Capstone Project.

## Project Overview

The commercial space industry is evolving rapidly, with companies like SpaceX making space travel more affordable and accessible. In this data science capstone project, we take on the role of data scientists working for Space Y, a new rocket company aiming to compete with SpaceX. Our task is to determine the price of each launch and predict whether SpaceX will successfully reuse the first stage of its Falcon 9 rocket.

## Project Goals

- Determine the cost of SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launches.
- Predict the successful reuse of the Falcon 9 first stage using machine learning.
- Create informative dashboards for the Space Y team.

## Data Sources

- Publicly available data on SpaceX launches and outcomes.
- Data on rocket specifications, mission parameters, and payload details.

## Project Phases

The project can be divided into several key phases:

### Data Collection with API

In this phase, data is collected from various sources, including SpaceX API endpoints, to gather information on rocket launches, mission outcomes, and other relevant details.

### Data Collection with Web Scraping

Web scraping techniques are used to extract additional data from websites and online sources, enriching the dataset with valuable information.

### Data Wrangling

The collected data is preprocessed and cleaned, ensuring it is ready for analysis. This phase includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and handling missing values.

### EDA with SQL

SQL queries are leveraged to perform exploratory data analysis, gaining insights into the data from different angles. SQL allows for efficient data querying and analysis.

### EDA with Visualization Lab

Exploratory data analysis continues with the use of Python data visualization libraries. Informative charts, graphs, and visualizations are created to analyze
relationships and uncover patterns and trends.

### Interactive Visual Analytics with Folium

Using Folium to create interactive maps and visualize spatial data related to rocket launches and landing sites.

### Dashboard Application (Code)

Interactive dashboards are developed using Plotly Dash to present the findings and analysis results in an easily digestible format. The code for these dashboards is included in this repository.

### Predictive Analysis - Machine Learning Lab

Applying machine learning techniques to predict the success of SpaceX's first-stage reuse. Predictive models are built and trained to forecast whether the first stage will be reused.

### Final Presentation (Slide)

The project culminates in a final presentation that summarizes the findings, insights, and the results of the predictive analysis.
